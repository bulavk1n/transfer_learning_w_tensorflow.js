Transfer Learning Example, using TensorFlow.js

See the demo.mp4 file attached

This is a custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js, a powerful and flexible machine learning library for Javascript. Good Example of a technique called "transfer learning", which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.
